# Gene Annotation

This directory reproduces the steps for building gene annotations for the *P. drummondii* genome.



* `fast_prep/`: Preparing (merging, trimming) RNA-Seq FASTQs for downstream alignment
* `hisat2_stringtie/`: Alignment and transcriptome assembly
* `transdecoder/`: Inferring gene models/CDS-annotations from the assembled transcriptome
